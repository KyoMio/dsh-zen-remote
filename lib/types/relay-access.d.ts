/**
 * Pure access control for the relay invoke route (2.0.0 desktop-client).
 *
 * PER-METHOD ALLOWLIST, not a generic id scan. The first draft extracted
 * whatever session ids it could find in `args.request` and checked those —
 * which a hostile client defeats with a DECOY: DSH's gateway validates only
 * the top-level argument names (`assertExactArguments`) and zod silently
 * strips unknown fields inside `request`, so padding the arguments with an
 * extra shared `sessionId` gets through the share-table check while the
 * method's REAL ownership field (`agentId`, `request.parentSessionId`, …)
 * goes unchecked. The fix: every invokable method is registered below with
 * EXACTLY the fields that locate its session, authorization looks at those
 * fields and nothing else, and any method not in the table is refused
 * (`forbidden-method`) before an id is ever read.
 *
 * Field verification (T22a-fix, against the 0.2.0-rc.1 wire inventory in the
 * review's keys.txt and the local `typert.remote-client.js` — the spike
 * proved those files byte-identical across 0.1.7/0.2.0, docs/spike-relay.md
 * §2.3):
 *
 * - `request.address` exists only on `session/follow` and `session/page`;
 *   its zod schema is a union of EXACTLY two shapes —
 *   `{kind:'session', sessionId}` and `{kind:'subagent', parentSessionId,
 *   childSessionId, mode}` — and DSH's `validateAddress` re-checks that the
 *   child belongs to the parent, so judging a subagent call by the parent id
 *   is authoritative. Any other kind, or a missing id, is a refusal.
 * - every other registered method carries `request.sessionId`.
 *
 * Pure functions: no I/O, no clock, the share-table lookup is injected.
